Loan Approval Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting loan approval using a machine learning model. The project focuses on determining whether a loan should be approved or not based on various factors such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

Project Overview

In this project, we use logistic regression to classify loan applications as either approved or not approved. The dataset consists of features like income, loan amount, and credit history, which are used to train the model.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on:

	•	Applicant Income: Monthly income of the loan applicant.
	•	Co-applicant Income: Monthly income of the co-applicant.
	•	Loan Amount: The loan amount applied for.
	•	Loan Amount Term: The duration of the loan.
	•	Credit History: A binary variable indicating if the applicant has a credit history.
	•	Property Area: Urban, semi-urban, or rural location of the property.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, where the model is trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set.

Model

Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used as the primary machine learning algorithm in this project. It’s a simple yet effective classification algorithm, particularly suited for binary classification problems like this one.
